# 🧠 Day 18–23 of Smart Contract Auditing — CodeHawks First Flights & Course Continuation

---

## 🎯 Overview
These 5 days (Day 18–22) were focused on my **first competitive audit** through  
[CodeHawks First Flights — RaiseBox Faucet](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/c/2025-10-raisebox-faucet).  
The goal wasn’t to win — it was to gain **real auditing experience** and understand how competitive audits work in practice.

---

## 🚀 What I Did
- Participated in **CodeHawks’ RaiseBox Faucet** audit contest 🧑‍💻  
- Reviewed real smart contracts deployed for testing purposes  
- Performed both **manual analysis** and **tool-assisted scanning**
- Documented all findings using the standard **TITLE (Root + Impact) → Description → Severity → Risk → Impact → Tools Used → Recommended mitigation → Proof of Concepts(with code)** format  
- Submitted all issues within the competition deadline

## 🧩 Key Learnings
### 1️⃣ Real Audit Workflow
- Understood how **scoping, recon, and reporting** are done under real timelines  
- Learned to balance **speed vs accuracy** — prioritizing impactful bugs first  
- Experience with **time-boxed auditing** (a skill essential for professional audits)

### 2️⃣ Practical Finding Identification
Identified several vulnerabilities during review (some repeated, some unique):
- Missing validation checks  
- Access control misconfiguration  
- Gas optimization and logic simplification  
- Inconsistent storage variable usage  

Even though this was a **testnet-based audit**, the process felt very close to a real bounty.

### 3️⃣ Competitive Audit Mindset
- Learned how to **structure and report findings** clearly for reviewers  
- Understood how multiple auditors analyze the same protocol differently  
- Realized that **collaboration and comparison** improve overall understanding  

> “Results don’t matter — experience does 💪”

## 🧠 Reflection
This competition gave me a taste of **real-world auditing pressure** — limited time, multiple files, and decision-making under constraints.  
It built my confidence in:
- Reading complex codebases faster  
- Recognizing recurring vulnerability patterns  
- Writing clean and concise audit reports

## 🔁 Back to Cyfrin Updraft
After completing the CodeHawks audit, I’ve resumed my learning from **Day 23** —  
continuing the **Cyfrin Smart Contract Auditing Course** where I left off after Day 17.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks Used
- **Foundry** (tests, PoCs)
- **Slither**, **Aderyn** (static analysis)
- **VS Code + Solidity extension**
- **Markdown template** for report writing

---

## 📘 Next Steps
- Continue Cyfrin’s auditing course from where I paused  
- Apply lessons learned from competitive auditing to improve speed & accuracy  
- Start preparing for **next CodeHawks flight** after completing the course
